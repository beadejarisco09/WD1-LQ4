    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>The iPhone 11's performance is good for everyday tasks, powered by the A13 Bionic chip, though multitasking can be impacted by its 4GB of RAM. It handles casual use like browsing and texting smoothly, with respectable single-core performance. While it can run graphically demanding games, it may require lower settings and cause the device to warm up, especially during extended use. </p>
